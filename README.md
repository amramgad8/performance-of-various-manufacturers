# Data Analysis for Business Insights

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project performed as part of my internship with **Uneeq**. The goal of this project was to analyze manufacturer data and identify key manufacturers that could be suitable for future business partnerships. 

The analysis includes evaluating manufacturers based on various factors such as total sales, total profit, product pricing, and the category of products (especially focusing on **computers**). The findings from the analysis can help businesses make informed decisions about which manufacturers to collaborate with based on performance metrics.

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the performance of various manufacturers by looking at the following criteria:

- **Total Sales**: The overall sales volume for each manufacturer.
- **Total Profit**: The total profit each manufacturer generates.
- **Product Pricing**: The average price of products across different categories.
- **Product Categories**: Analyzing the categories of products sold by each manufacturer, particularly focusing on **computers**.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Y Data Profiling**: Used for generating automated data profiles and understanding the distribution, correlations, and potential issues within the dataset.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: Libraries used to generate visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and descriptive statistics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used to write and run the analysis code interactively.

## Key Insights

1. **Best Manufacturer for Business Relationships**:
   - Based on total sales and profit, **Fabrikam, Inc.** emerged as the top manufacturer for business partnerships. It generated **$12,054,281.48** in total sales and has the highest profit margins in the dataset.
   - **Contoso, Ltd.** followed closely with **$10,561,497.35** in sales and would be a good option for more affordable partnerships.

2. **Best Manufacturer for Computers**:
